# G&S Example 3.11
Chapter 3 of G&amp;S, Example 3.11 binomial distribution simulation

H_o: p=.6
H_a: p>.6

n = number people given aspirin
m = critical value

TypeI = reject H_o when H_o is indeed true. Determine new is better when it is not.
TypeII = fail to reject H_o then H_o is false.  Miss the fact that new is indeed better.

Goal: Want both TypeI (alpha) and TypeII (beta) to be less than 0.05.
